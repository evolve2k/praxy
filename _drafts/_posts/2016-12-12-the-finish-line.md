The Finish Line

The project is now finished and submitted, and although I was active in the blogging our process through the project initially, i haven't posted in some time. This was down to a few points, firstly being as momentum took off and time frames tightened, the blog posts became less important to my design process and make a formal entry of where I was at became less helpful. Secondly I suffered a major injury during the project, breaking my collarbone in a bicycle accident, being unable to work for two weeks, and having my momentum hindered from there on. I was still periodically visiting the blog up to this point but it well and truly fell away following this as the pressure of the deadline approached.

While i did not keep up with the blogging, I still did thoroughly document the design and production of the project through workbooks, sketches, photos and physical artefacts. Overall itâ€™s been loads of fun and great learning experience working and design with a totally different media in mind.

This post is a recap of the ideation and production of the work through the documentation that was made, and highlights the process and learnings discovered through working on the project.
