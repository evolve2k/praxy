As we continue working on this project I have found it useful, at lest in my own mind, to begin to develop a way of thinking about and focusing on things so as not to be overwhelmed and pulled in too many directions by all the work required. This has been achieved by breaking the thinking around the project into three sections, the technical and how we make the praxinoscopes work, the visual presentation, and the conceptual and communicative quality of the work.

These three areas are all important to the creation of the final work, but i found that breaking them apart allows me to focus on things individually and more effectively solve problems that i am encountering.

This week Richie and I have been continuing along the same path as last week, trying to create as many hand drawn animations as possible to explore the technical boundaries and requirements of the media, while also injecting a more simple conceptual ideas. This is working ok and we are coming up with some reasonable work, but I feel that for the moment we have covered enough technical ground and need to focus on further developing concepts and defining a clear visual style.

The plan to accomplish this is to meet and discuss and compile a long list of concepts and ideas, and ways which they can be visually represented. We also separately are compiling our own visual inspiration boards to try to hone in on the visual feel we wish to achieve. We plan to meet and resolve these issue early next week and make this the primary focus for the short term.

As for successful animation this week, I produced this simple piece that tries to combine all 3 of the key focus areas. It is a hand drawn technically functioning animation that communicates humans being lost and confused by the machine and references early 1900s futurist imagery.
