As we continued to refine our animations it became increasingly clear that we needed to resolve a consistent visual style across our works. Not only for the animation but also for the project as a whole.

It took a while to agree on the asthetic but finally we agreed on an 80's neon style and this tied in well with a futuristic technology driven asthetic we were aiming for.

We had agreed that we wanted to use a black background for our animations. After a weekend of research we found that Posca pens would ink well onto black card and had a high opacity so that the colour stood out clearly on the black card.
