As we continued to refine our animations it became increasingly clear that we needed to resolve a consistent visual style across our works. Not only for the animation but also for the project as a whole.

It took a while to agree on the Aesthetic but finally we agreed on an 80's neon style and this tied in well with a futuristic technology driven aesthetic we were aiming for.

We had agreed that we wanted to use a black background for our animations. After a weekend of research we found that Posca pens would ink well onto black card and had a high opacity so that the colour stood out clearly on the black card.

We printed our design in black on black card and then used the posca ink pens to ink in the details by hand. We were very happy with the result which provided bold colours and also achieved a more hand drawn animation style.

## The mirrors need work

As our animations became more refined we started to find that the temporary hand cut mirrors we had been using were letting down the animations and we knew these needed work to make them produce more consistent results.

We had decided to laser cut the mirrors, but how to make the mirrors and the base stand together as a unit? We undertook a bunch of mental calculations towards working out exactly the size of everything we needed to cut.

Experiments were made printing an inner core to the 3D printer but in the end effective use of the laser cutter led us to the desired results.

The other thing we tested was sticking everything together with a hot glue gun. This turned out to be surprisingly effective and more stable than expected.

With a bit of careful gluing and some tape, we managed to pull the Praxinoscope carousels together.

We were very happy with the final result.

And the improvement from using the newly refined carousels was significant.
