This week has been about exploring visual styles and concepts, but has ended up building our technical process as well.

Early in the week we set about compiling a long list of concepts and ways to achieve them. We sat down and wrote and came to close to 100 points. This was a really useful collective brain dump and has given us lots to explore. It has also already proved helpful for when you feel as if you want to sit down and make an animation, you immediately have a list of ideas to draw from. It should help us to wok faster going forward.

We also worked on creating a combined mood board that we could both work towards. This part was easier said than done and while more work is required we have agreed on certain points such as a neon 80 video game inspired colour palette and strong use of geometric shapes. Other ideas such as referencing modernism, isometric illustration and wireframe illustration are still being explored.

While exploring and trying to create these visuals we have stumbled cross what seems to be a successful process. Hand drawing the images is very slow and while we wished to have a hand drawn aesthetic included in the wok, we are not good enough illustrators and are not productive enough. We have therefore turned back to the machines to help us achieve our goals.

I doing this and after playing around I have developed a process that works well for me. This is to do a hand illustration of the frames from the images and the recreate these in illustrator. I then take the basic shape and put that in to Cinema 4D and move it around as I wish. This allows me to see the object from different angles and perspectives, something I struggled with while hand drawing. I then apply the these angles to my illustrator drawing to produce my 12 frames of animation.

This process is fun and interesting and the opposite of how we had intended to work. I think this is a good part of this project however, and we are exploring our own relationship with technology and when we do and don't need it.
