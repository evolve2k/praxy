Undertaking this project has involved a steep learning curve.

We were attracted to praxinoscope based short frame animations as we saw they existed at this unique intersection of graphic and motion design. The same elements that make the medium unique have also contributed to complexity in creating works.

We have resolved issues by working on a number of fronts, specifically resolving technical considerations, getting better at creating animations and determining an effective style.

### Design Priorities
(in order of initial priority)

1. Motion is believable
2. Works are conceptually evocative
3. Consistent application of style
4. Understandable/ relatable for others
5. Aesthetic polish

### Getting started

Ruth Hayes and her website Random Motion were major inspirations for this project. 
Along side many great articles on motion, we utilised Hayes (2012) article 
How to Make a Praxinoscope and Praxinoscope Discs Using a Repurposed Record Turntable (http://www.randommotion.com/html/prax2.html) as a starting point towards creating praxinoscopes of our own.

We obtained turntables and initially crafted our mirrored prisms using reflective cardboard which was available for only a few dollars at OfficeWorks (a big box stationery store).

Early constructions were about confirming that we could actually make these things spin and achieve animations for ourselves.


The minimum viable product was to obtain a record player, setup a cheap mirrored prism and test simple animation. Early exploratory work proved that we could make workable animations on our self constructed praxinoscopes.
The Experimentation Phase


Having created working spinning praxinoscopes (praxys) and having agreed that we’d focus on 12 frame animations attention then turned to producing works, and as quickly as we could.


Creating evocative works proved difficult and harder than originally expected.

To start with progress was slow and we found it incredibly difficult to conceptualise an idea, work out if we had the skills to hand draw the piece and then go about the task of creating the related 12 frame animation on each frame on our record shaped animation template.

During this phase I worked on enhancing my skills at creating hand drawn works and also on achieving a smooth animation effect. I also took a different approach to each animated work I produced, testing different styles. 

My initial focus was on creating functioning animations rather than focussing on developing works aligned with the narrative and work towards our first priority of determining approaches to create believable motion.

This animation experimented with the fact that viewers can see more than one frame a time and also featured my preliminary colour palette.


### Exploring style

We continued to practice creating animations and this was good to continue to refine our understanding,but as we approached greater confidence in how to make these animations at the same time the lack of having an agreed effective style became increasingly an issue.


With a unique medium and coupled conceptually focus the importance of determining a style that 
We both agreed would work effectively.
Which reflected well the conceptual focus of the works.
Was visually attractive.
Reflected our project values of working on and specifically away from the computer.


After initial experimentation to prove that praxinoscopes could be an effective medium for animation, we entered a dark patch where ideas didn’t seem to flow and our works felt below our expectations. People asked us, ‘yes but how will the finished works look?’. We had some ideas of what we were hoping to see but in reality we did not yet know. 


Our initial explorations came about from questioning 'which design periods were concerned with questioning the future and technology', surprisingly on reflection there have been many periods concerned with questions of technology and the future.


We researched and explored many styles and approaches both digital in nature and non-digital. Styles that we explored in further detail included, Futurism, Space Age, Japanese Anime and 1980’s neon digital. Styles we reviewed for aesthetic appeal, ability for us to leverage and interpret and connection to the project theme.


Having agreed to a 1980's neon digital aesthetic we shortly after realized still how wide this genre was especially when we include the scope of contemporary interpretations of this period. 


We want our work not to date as a period piece but rather be a contemporary work drawing from this earlier era for inspiration. 
Easing the conceptual progress


Another area of pressure has been working out the conceptual basis for our works.
Initially we’d start a new animation and have to consider everything from what message were we trying to portray, to what sort of animation did we want to explore to what approach we’d take to create the particular animation, hand-drawn, computer driven or which combination of both.


One step that really helped was us sitting down and together coming up with a list of evocative ideas and concepts we wanted to explore through our works. We made a long list and then from that sorted a top 5 to focus on first. Being able to peruse a list of conceptual ideas and consider how we might animate them or even coming the other way with an animation technique we wanted to explore and browsing the list for suitable fits definitely helped us break an impasse and we’ve been much more productive since.


### Uncovering a workable style

After selecting 1980’s neon digital as the style we added neon wireframes as our specific focus. A spinning camera design was well received by lectures and class mates and sent a clear visual message of minimalism, simplicity, storytelling as well as was evocative of the neon period, we decided to continue exploring in this direction.

The question then was how to build on this aesthetic. We swung back at this point to working again with computers and focussed on creating animations with Cinema 4D. Working in 3D offered the opportunity to greatly simplify achieving believable physics and movement across our frames. The question remained how to make the work pop and be more unique than just a series of short Cinema 4D frames printed out on the laser printer using CMYK colours.

My next personal shift was finding a felt colouring book used by my daughter. The coloured sections were surrounded by a rich black background created by the use of felt as a backdrop.
A visit to a craft store quickly highlighted that recreating this look would not be easily achievable.

 My next approach was to explore neon paints and glow in the dark paints. Eventually after a few visits to Eckersley Craft Supplies I worked out we could use ink pens that show up very well on black card. The black card offers a similarly striking background and the Ink pens showed surprising well on the black card. Now we were achieving colours that would be difficult to achieve with a colour printer. Another win here was realising we could print directly onto the card in black in, which would provide a faint barely visible outline of the shapes we wanted to colour, by then inking in by hand we had added back a component of working offline to our workflow and also the result didn’t seem overly digital and even slightly cartoonish. I think work can still be done to refine technique and process but for the moment I am very happy we’ve found a consistent workflow and visual style to work to that combines working digitally and off the computer in the creation of each work.
Final Thoughts

In my proposal I set myself a challenge to create 20 works in 20 days, I am at the point now where I can create works to a consistent workflow that will reliably all achieve a similar level of finish suitable for display as working prototypes. I set this challenge towards focussing me on getting my iteration rate up and I felt it has helped put focus in this area.

I’m now considering a shorter sprint that will align with what we’ve now come to understand about the project. I will discuss this with Liam further but I expect to create a number of new works at a greater rate over the next 1-2 weeks.

A personal objective has also been to document our progress, I think I have well recorded each of the animations I have created and also I have effectively hosted a blog for the project online.

The blog although containing a number of draft posts and various placeholder information could do with more work, but I’ll work on that as a secondary consideration. Im convinced now that effective documentation as a project progresses is possibly and highly valuable but it does require additional allocation of resources to firstly consistently collect useful images and artifacts as the project progresses and secondly it takes time to prepare updates and documentation that might be appealing for others to read and review. I’ve allocated some time to this, would love to dedicate more, but remain focussed on delivering the primary works as the key objective.

In other news we have also over this time negotiated with the university to have Torrens register as an official Adelaide Fringe venue and we’ll be displaying our work as a window installation at Torrens as part of the 2017 Adelaide Fringe. 

We are on track with the project plan and I’m also very aware there is still much to do.
