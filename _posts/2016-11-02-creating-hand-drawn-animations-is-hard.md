Yes. It's hard.

I'm sure it would help if I was a naturally gifted illustrator but as a digital designer getting pen onto paper is proving more difficult than I had initially imagined.

Just because something is hard though, is not reason enough to stop doing it. 
One of the attractions of working digitally is that the computer makes everything so much simpler, it's easy to get nice straight lines, it's easy to duplicate and copy and it's easy to revise your work when it's off.

So why persevere when my work currently looks so, dare I say amature? 
Because to level up at new skills takes time and resolving practical real world issues is worth the time. 

With each iteration I'm getting better.
