As we continued to refine our animations it became increasingly clear that we needed to resolve a consistent visual style across our works. Not only for the animation but also for the project as a whole.

It took a while to agree on the Aesthetic but finally we agreed on an 80's neon style and this tied in well with a futuristic technology driven aesthetic we were aiming for.

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">We had agreed that we wanted to use a black background for our animations. After a weekend of research we found that Posca pens would ink well onto black card and had a high opacity so that the colour stood out clearly on the black card.</span>

We printed our design in black on black card and then used the posca ink pens to ink in the details by hand. We were very happy with the result which provided bold colours and also achieved a more hand drawn animation style.

## The mirrors need work

As our animations became more refined we started to find that the temporary hand cut mirrors we had been using were letting down the animations and we knew these needed work to make them produce more consistent results.

We had decided to laser cut the mirrors, but how to make the mirrors and the base stand together as a unit? We undertook a bunch of mental calculations towards working out exactly the size of everything we needed to cut.

Experiments were made printing an inner core to the 3D printer but in the end effective use of the laser cutter led us to the desired results.

The other thing we tested was sticking everything together with a hot glue gun. This turned out to be surprisingly effective and stronger than expected.

With a bit of careful gluing and some tape, we managed to pull the Praxinoscope carousels together.

We were very happy with the final result.

## 3D Rendered Assets

As we progressed we started to find that the hand animations were both taking a lot of time and also we were not able to generate smooth animations without hours and hours of trial and error.

Following experiments with cinema 4D we came across a working process of creating our animations as 3D assets and then placing rendered frames onto record templates.

An endless stack of servers was an early test for me and followed on with my success with the bitcoin animation.

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;" class="">The trick with this animation is that I was able to use all the frames to just move from one corner of the building the the very next corner and then repeat. The animation however gives the illusion that it it's slowly rotating around all 4 sides of the building. This created an animation that seemed to run slower than other animations I had created. We were gradually uncovering and exploring the finer points of the illusion of motion that frame animation provides.</span>

## Multi frame animation

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;" class="">One thing I noticed as we practiced animating on the Praxinoscopes was the interesting effect of how you could see multiple frames at a time. I wondered if it might be possibly to create animations that told a story across a few frames. </span>

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;" class="">My opportunity came when developing "Voting Machine" a voting machine that was also a Pokie machine.</span>

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;" class="">Initially I constructed a full US style voting machine and booth. </span>

But refining down I simplified the concept down to the machine & its handle and then just down to the frames themselves.

## Lighting

Lighting of the work was always going to be important. From standard testing we found that the combination of glossy paper and the reflection from bright overhead lights, together reduced the legibility of the works.

We experimented with building internal LED lights into each record player towards creating a self contained, self lit device. Standard LED's worked effectively, but experimentation with Black UV lights yielded results that really started to achieve an effective neon aesthetic.

These experiments revealed that it was especially hard to have these small lights stay exactly where we wanted them and also, with Liam having one arm down, was going to take us a long time to wire up. In the end we opted for exploring external lighting options and we also ordered a Black UV light in the hope it would arrive before the exhibit (it did!).

When the final exhibit came together we utilised a spotlight to effectively light the center stage of our exhibit and relied upon LED strip lightining to light other assets. The combination of the Black UV light as well as the UV Gell over the large downlight in the space worked together effectively to add to the neon ambiance of the space.

## Experimentation & Testing

The project went through continuous phases of experimentation and testing and in many ways was defined by our lean approach to development and experimentation. After Liam's accident, and following a shock of stress on what we would do, we developed the idea of the "Minimum Viable Exhibit" and defined what was the core minimal activities we needed to resolve to make the exhibit work. This kept us highly focussed on what was most important. We knew then that if we got to an effective minimum as quickly as we could, we could get feedback earlier and also have the most time possible to add polish & refinement after.

At each stage, faced with unknows, we asked what was the simplest way we could undertake a test and resolve problems as early as possibly. Sometimes this involved pretending to put up curtains before we did by asking a lecturer to stand on a ladder and 'hold them up', across to printing out our designs on white paper before committing the designs to our good card so we might quickly identify any issues with the design before using up our costly resources.

Another effective technique was to setup a single Praxinoscope on a plynth next to our computers and to regularly print our animations onto record templates and test them live. Resolving a template in InDesign that made it easy to update the frames by updating links in the document, helped streamline our workflow and further led to us getting towards effective animations as quickly as was possible.

# Considering our process

## Production

The production of the Praxinoscopes was highly complex and involved many stages. By sticking to our timeline with a focus on major milestones we were able to abstract many of these small stages of experimentation and production into significant chunks of focus and development. Right up to Liam's accident we kept the project on track with our timeline, with Liam off base for around a fortnight we lost some of the momentum we were building before the accident. Without effective buffers and conservative estimates in our timeline we could have been very far off from delivering a finished result come exhibition day. One area that became a time sink was the refinement of our animations onto the Praxinoscopes.

## Feedback

We were proactive in obtaining feedback on the project, leveraging the expertise of Darren, David and James primarily. Although we had a mix of feedback from each lecturer by and large we settled into a feedback cycle whereby generally we received graphic design feedback from Darren, feedback on our animations from James, and feedback and support on production approaches from David. Liam and I were generally in at uni most of the time, and pretty much daily we received and sought feedback from one lecturer or another on most days we were in. It helped that our project was delivered on a unique medium and was multifaceted in it's scope and approach and as a result we received much feedback from the lecturers often with us all contemplating solutions to problems for which non of us had previous specific experience resolving.

## Conclusions

This project has been multi-faceted and included many unique design considerations and challenges. In the end I am very happy with the work we have produced.
