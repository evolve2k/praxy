Interim Progress Report
-----------------------
Undertaking this project has been an ongoing personal challenge.
With complexity on many fronts we have often found ourselves in what feels like catch 22 situations. Where we we feel we need to resolve issue 2 to help us resolve issue 1 but that resolving issue 1 will also help resolve issue 2. There have been numerous points in the project so far that have felt this way.

We have resolved issues by seeking progress on a number of fronts. The project has needed resolution of technical issues and workflow. Conceptual development of ideas, and execution of prototype animations to assess whether each conceptual motion piece will work practically.

We made progress on various fronts but over the last 2 weeks the question of what is our guiding style had dominated our considerations. Without clear direction on style we've often felt that a key component was missing towards making other decisions especially when spending time to create animation prototypes.

Animation Aspects
-----------------
(in order of initial priority)

Motion is believable
Conceptually evocative
Consistent application of style
Understandable/relatable
Aesthetic polish



Progression of style
--------------------
Early works were prepared as experiments primarily in animation and playing with the medium.
Here I experimented with just getting my frames give the illusion of animation.
